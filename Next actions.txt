Fix commit sync so this never blocks again

Add a repo file that contains the current commit hash (committed), e.g. docs/COMMIT_SHA.txt.

Then your prompt (and any zip export) has a deterministic “what commit is this?” answer even without .git/.

Architecture next step (before coding): introduce a generic “Series/Format” layer

Your docs already define “Match = one playthrough instance of a Game” (so your instinct “RPS = 1 round” is consistent).

So: keep Game/Match minimal; move “best_of / first_to / timeboxed” into a generic orchestrator above MatchRunner.

Pick one scope option (2 max):

Option A (recommended): keep CURRENT_MILESTONE = ADR0002 (Stats/Query) intact; we create ADR0003 for Series/Format + typed actions/policies, then start S14 for implementation.

Option B: treat this as still part of S13 and extend ADR0002 scope (risk: milestone creep + stats layer gets delayed).
