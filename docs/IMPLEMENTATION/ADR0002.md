# Implementation Notes — ADR0002

## Goal of ADR0002 (implemented)
Make iteration scalable by adding:
- better test organization
- repeatable ADR execution patterns

## What was implemented
- `test_ADR/` contains ADR-specific runnable modules (e.g. `python -m test_ADR.ADR0001`)
- A common helper runner exists (`test_ADR/_adr_common.py`)
- `test_ADR/run_all.py` executes all active ADR modules in order

## Practical conventions
- Prefer `python -m ...` execution from repo root
- Keep slice tests small and deterministic
- Keep slice numbers monotonic across ADRs

## Notes
ADR0002 is mostly about workflow and does not introduce new engine semantics.
