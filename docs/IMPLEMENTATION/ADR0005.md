# Implementation Notes — ADR0005 (Planned)

## Goal of ADR0005 (planned)
Support multi-phase games using an internal OOP structure that avoids large if/elif blocks in:
- legal_actions
- apply_actions

## Intended implementation approach
- Keep the public engine interface (`Game`) unchanged
- Introduce a reusable pattern for games:
  - state contains `phase` and `memory`
  - game delegates to `PhaseRules` objects keyed by phase

## Planned minimal deliverables
- A base “phase rules” protocol/interface
- A small example game that truly requires phases
  - example: Buy/Play/Both/Pass token game
- Policies that branch on phase and memory
- ADR runner tests validating:
  - correct phase transitions
  - correct legality rules per phase
  - deterministic behavior

## Not in scope yet
- hidden information / private state
- parameterized actions
- decks/chance systems
