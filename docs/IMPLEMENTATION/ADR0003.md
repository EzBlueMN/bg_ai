# Implementation Notes — ADR0003

## Goal of ADR0003 (implemented)
Introduce clean separation between:
- a single match (a single game execution)
- multiple matches (series / formats)
and improve action typing.

## What was implemented
- `ActionEnum` base class for wire-safe typed actions
- RPS refactor to single-round per match
- Matching Fingers game (single-round)
- SeriesRunner:
  - BestOfN
  - FirstToN
- Series-level events (Option A):
  - series_start
  - series_match_completed
  - series_end

## Key design rules
- Games remain single-match
- Multi-match orchestration lives outside games (SeriesRunner)
- Event payload must remain JSON-serializable:
  - enums are converted to wire strings in logs

## Known limitations
- Series events reuse the existing Event envelope and temporarily use:
  - match_id = series_id
  - tick = -1
This is acceptable short-term but may evolve later.
