# Implementation Notes — ADR0001

This file contains implementation-focused notes and practical constraints used during ADR0001.

## Key files (approx)
- engine: match execution loop
- events: model + sinks + JSONL codecs
- replay: deterministic reproduction

## Practical rules
- events must remain JSON-serializable
- avoid non-deterministic sources in game/policy (time, random without RNG)
- prefer `python -m ...` execution from repo root

## Testing style
- ADR runners in `test_ADR/` validate slices
- `test_ADR.run_all` executes all active ADR runners
